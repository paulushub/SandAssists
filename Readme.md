Sandcastle Assist project aims to provide a .NET library that will make it easier to use the Sandcastle tool, a documentation compiler for managed libraries from Microsoft. 

Microsoft's [Sandcastle](http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle) is a set of help or documentation compilers for managed class libraries. It enables managed class library developers to create accurate, informative documentation with a common look and feel.

The Sandcastle Assist project will provide extension libraries and utility classes to help make the process of creating a documentation with the Sandcastle tools easier. It will be the Sandcastle SDK, and we will work hard to make it good!

### Development Roadmap
We have made progress in most of our projects, especially the more time consuming [Sandcastle Workshop](Sandcastle-Workshop). We have started drawing up the roadmap, and we invite you to work with us to realize it. We welcome any feedback; suggestions and criticisms (please feel free to judge us, and let us know how we are doing), and your precious time in testing.
