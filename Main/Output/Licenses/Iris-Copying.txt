Preamble

Two main pieces make up Iris: 

 1) Original C# code, and 
 2) The syntax definition files that were all taken from the Vim text editor. 
	The syntax files are all in the syntax\ subdirectory and have extension 
   ".vim".

The Vim Editor lives at :

			http://www.vim.org and 

It was created by Bram Moolenaar. A large number of contributors have created 
the syntax files. The names of the maintainers and original authors are 
preserved in the files. The files are shipped verbatim as they appear in the 
Vim editor, except for very minor technical modifications due to limitations 
in our Vim script parser.

I. SYNTAX FILES

THE COPYRIGHT FOR VIM AND ITS SYNTAX FILES IS IN FILE uganda.txt

The two main points regarding the syntaxes are:

1) If you modify them, you must be willing to share your modifications upon
   request. Please read uganda.txt for details.
2) You are encouraged to donate to children in Uganda, giving to a project
   in which the Vim author has worked extensively. This is _not a generic
   charity_, but rather a small charity personally involving the author.
   Its website is:
  
			http://iccf-holland.org/   
   
We encourage you to contribute to Uganda if Iris is useful to you. It's 
only possible due to Vim, after all. 

II. IRIS

			http://duartes.org/iris

All of the remaning work in Iris has been done from the ground up and does
not involve Vim source code nor is it derived from such. We do encourage you 
to donate to ICCF Holland as well. Iris itself is under the license below:
