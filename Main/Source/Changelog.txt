************* Change Date: 12:47 AM Saturday, October 01, 2011 ***************

In general:
1. Added Sandcastle.XsdDocs.dll, for XSD documentations.
	- Uses a customized version of the XML Schema Documenter by Immo Landwerth
	- Original source available at http://xsddoc.codeplex.com/ 
2. Added Sandcastle.Composition project: For plugin support.
	- Based on the current snapshot of the MEF Preview 6
	- Will be used for both .NET 3.5 and 4.0, renamed/signed to avoid confusion.
3. Added Sandcastle.Construction project: Manage proj without MSBuild dependency.
	A. Microsoft.Build.Construction implementations from the Mono Project
		- This is implemented by Leszek Ciesielski
	B. VC++ Projects equivalent of the Microsoft.Build.Constructions
		- Implemented to provide access to VC++ projects from VC++ 2003.
	C. Project Sections: Extracts relevant info from VS.NET projects and solutions
		- This presents a common interface to all projects.
		- The extracted information includes assembly/project references etc.
4. Completed work on most file formats and serialization of all the classes.

For the Core:
1. Tag resolver or formatter, for text with macros like ${TagName:Formatting|Function}
2. Frameworks: Added support for Portable Class Library, Script# and Silverlight 5.0
3. BuildPathResolver: Reworked and no longer locked.

For the Helpers:
1. Lots of work on documentation (content and group) sources
	A. ConceptualXsdDocSource: For XML Schema documentation using Sandcastle.XsdDocs.dll.
	B. ConceptualImportSource: Imports ConceptualContent from other projects.
	C. ReferenceImportSource: Imports ReferenceContent from other projects.
		- You can override TOC, type/attribute filters etc.
	D. ReferenceVsNetSource: For VS.NET projects/solutions
		- For VC++ 2005/2008/2010, solution files is required for macros
		- Also, the active platform/configuration is extracted from the hidden *.suo file.
	E. ReferenceDirectorySource: Documents all assemblies with comments a dir.
	F. ReferenceAjaxDocSource: NOT supported for the current version
		- Delayed due to AjaxDoc implementations
		- Looking for a more flexible/secured implementation of the Javascript docs
	G. ReferenceLinkSource: To resolves links to 3rd party libraries.
		- Importantly, it allows third party library docs to be embedded into yours.
		- The 3rd parties libraries will not show in the TOC.
		- For Script#, it is auto-generated since there is no MSDN for Script# base classes.
2. ReferenceDependencyResolver renamed ReferenceProjectVisitor for consistency
3. Added ConceptualProjectVisitor, reworking all the previous visitors for speed.

For the Components and ReflectionData:
1. Fixed a bug in DatabaseTargetTextStorage, it assumed there is a cached database.
	- This resulted in "Reference link unknown" error in builds
	- Was working on my local system, which has the cached database.

For the Builders
1. Started work on the final assembly, which will bring support for MSBuild etc
2. Completed work on file and project templates handling/creating classes.
	- The file templates will be used for all file generated for Sandcastle by editors
	- The project templates are currently MSBuild based for Sandcastle Assist projects.
	- The templates are improvements on formats by #Develop and similar to VS.NET.
