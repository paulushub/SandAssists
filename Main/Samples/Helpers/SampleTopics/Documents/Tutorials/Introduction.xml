        <!--<title>Introduction</title>-->
        <introduction>
            <para>
                In this article we will present the conceptual help introduced in the
                October 2007 CTP release of the Sandcastle Help Compiler System.
            </para>
            <para>
                Previous release of the Sandcastle provided support for building API
                references for source codes based on the .NET XML-Doc format. While
                this may be useful in most cases, a complete software documentation
                will include two parts; the API reference documentation and the
                "User Manual".
            </para>
            <para>
                While some software provide the manual in the Microsoft Word or Adobe
                PDF formats, most of us prefer the HTML format. In the HTML format,
                we prefer a look and feel similar to the API reference documentation.
            </para>
            <para>
                Many companies are now providing only the online help systems; not only
                is this convenience, more useful and cost saving, but it also makes our
                Al Gore happy!
            </para>
            <alert class="note">
                <para>
                    <legacyBold>Al Gore</legacyBold> might refuse to be renamed 
                    <legacyBold>Al Green</legacyBold>, because writing that
                    might take more paper space, more energy to spell out, and more
                    ink and coal to print!
                </para>
            </alert>
            <para>
                Now, with the release of the October 2007 CTP, even the poorest ISV
                can produce a professional documentations at a price he/she can 
                afford - free.
            </para>
            <para>
                Well, "free" itself is a price and in this case very expensive one. 
                The conceptual help support in the Sandcastle came without a 
                documentation (the documenter is not documented), making it difficult
                for the current Sandcastle GUI providers to integrate it into their
                tools.
            </para>
            <para>
                This article, therefore, aims to provide the following: 
            </para>

                        Reduce the "free" cost of learning to use the conceptual help
                        so that many can explore the potentials of this useful tool.

                Basically, I am trying to share with you all I have, currently, in my
                attempt to learn and master the conceptual help support in Sandcastle.
                I will be releasing a series of articles on this, but have provided
                all the tools and facilities in the accompanying download files, so
                that you will not have to work at my pace.
            </para>
            <para>
                In this article, I will present the <legacyBold>Quick Start</legacyBold>
                to both introduce you and get you started. It will also help me gather
                information for the next article.

            <para>
                Now, for those new to Sandcastle's conceptual help, let me give
                a "free" screen-shot of a typically output, which is actually part of
                the download files.

            <title>What is Conceptual Help?</title>
            <content>
                <para>
                    Conceptual means pertaining to concepts or to the forming of 
                    concepts, so a conceptual help is a documentation of the concepts
                    or how your software program will help to realize some concepts or
                    ideas. Well, that is me trying to be technical, and believe me it
                    is not accurate. The accurate version follows...
                </para>
                <para>
                    The conceptual help is based on the Microsoft Assistance Markup 
                    Language or MAML, an XML-based markup language developed by the 
                    Microsoft User Assistance Platform team to provide user 
                    assistance for the Windows Vista. The ideal behind the MAML is
                    similar to DocBook (I do not know which is better).
                </para>
                <para>
                    The MAML consists of several distinct content types, each one 
                    specific to a type of document. The MAML content types include: 
                    conceptual, glossary, procedural or how-to, reference, 
                    troubleshooting, etc.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The term "conceptual help" is actually a out of place since the
                    "conceptual content" is a just one of the content types defined
                    by the MAML.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The MAML specification is currently not available, but the Sandcastle
                    Team provided the schema of a derived version for developers. The
                    schema is currently incomplete, which is adding to the "free" cost
                    I mentioned earlier.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The schema for the conceptual content type, which is the most
                    generic of all the content types, is shown below:
                </para>

                <para>
                    Here is an example of the conceptual help structure (the reality is
                    different from the schema, an indication of an incomplete schema):

                            The <legacyBold>&lt;title&gt;</legacyBold> tag is actually required
                            for a successful compilation of the help, even thought not
                            included in the schema.

                            The <legacyBold>&lt;topic&gt;</legacyBold>'s id must be a GUID,
                            uniquely identifying each document in the help system.

                    Finally the good news: the Sandcastle Team provided the tool to
                    transform, with varying degree of completion and accuracy, the
                    various content types to both HtmlHelp 1.x and 2.x for the 
                    presentation styles supported. A typical output using the VS-2005
                    presentation style, which is the best supported style, is shown
                    above.

                                    This is not just another example, but the main thing,
                                    and what I really want you to have.

                                    It is an illustrative example that shows you what
                                    you can do with the Sandcastle, and if you take a
                                    look at the source to see how it was done.
