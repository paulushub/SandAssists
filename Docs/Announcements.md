**January 20, 2009 - Sandcastle Custom Build Components**
With the [Sandcastle Helpers](Sandcastle-Helpers) as the build testing library, we are now restarting the work on the [Sandcastle Build Components](Sandcastle-Build-Components). We will develop it to at least a beta stage to make it ready for the final round of Sandcastle Helpers developments.

**December 4, 2008 - Sandcastle Helper Preview**
The preview of the Sandcastle Helpers will be released this weekend. We have sorted the problems and improved it. Also, we wish to announce that the Helpers library will become the Builders library. Please see the discussion forum for details.

**November 15, 2008 - Sandcastle Helper Preview - Delayed**
There is a delay in the promised release of the Sandcastle Helper preview. We have found faulty design/implementation that will limit the features of the library and currently working to rectify it. We are sorry for any inconvenience.

**October 08, 2008 - Changes and Developments**
* **Help 2.0 Registration Tools and Utilities**: We are happy to announce that we have the permission to distribute the Help 2.0 Registration tools and utilities written by [Mathias Simmack](http://www.simmack.de/tutorials/das-help-20-format/). These tools are free and are redistributable. We have completed the translation of the Help2Register documentation to English, and currently testing and preparing for release. We want to express our sincere gratitude to Mathias for giving the Sandcastle community this great tool.
* **Sandcastle Helpers**: We have completed the design and coding of major parts,  and currently preparing to release a CTP (next week) before the first beta version.

**July 25, 2008 - Changes and Developments**
* **MimeTeX**: We are stopping the support of the [MimeTeX](http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.html) in the [Math Component](Math-Component) due to licensing issues. To improve the input and output of the MimeTeX will require a lot of work, and the current license does not make it worth the effort. We will continue to improve the support of MikTeX, especially the speed in the math component.
* **SBAppLocale**: We have the permission to redistribute the [SBAppLocale](http://www.steelbytes.com/?mid=45), which will be used in DBCS fixing for the CHM output. We will integrate this into the [Sandcastle Builders](Sandcastle-Builders) tasks. We will also provide support for the [Microsoft AppLocale Utility](http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/apploc.mspx), where it is installed.
